        <h1>Travel Policy</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          At McHacks, we look forward to providing travel accomodation for as
          many attendees as we can. We care about bringing a great travel
          experience and so, we have outlined a few rules in this policy to
          adhere to that mission.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Our travel policy is complementary to the{" "}
          <a href="/code-of-conduct" target="_top">
            McHacks Code of Conduct
          </a>
          . If you’re an attendee with any travel accommodation, this policy
          applies alongside our Code of Conduct.
        </p>
        <h2>Buses</h2>
        <h3>Seat Capacity</h3>
        <p>
          Bus seats are available at a first-come first-serve basis to all
          attendees with an acceptance status on our hacker dashboard.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>

          to discuss arrangements for a refund so we can open the seat up to
          other interested attendees.
        </p>
        <h3>Deposits</h3>
        <p>
          To secure a seat on one of our buses, an attendee must place a
          monetary deposit at the time of seat security. Bus seats cannot be
          traded or sold to another attendee or person at anytime.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Bus deposits are refunded to the attendee if they (a) confirm their
          attendance on our hacker dashboard, (b) check-in to McHacks as a
          hacker, and (c) submit a project to at least one of our prize
          categories.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Deposits will be refunded to attendees upon review of the above
          qualifications and distributed within 15 days after McHacks.

          self-arranged travel is unaffiliated with McHacks and left to an
          attendee's discretion.
