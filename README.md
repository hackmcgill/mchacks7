## Deployment

We are using Vercel to compile and host our code. When a PR is created, Vercel builds the site and generates a deploy preview to confirm everything is working as expected. Once code is merged to `master` branch, Vercel will promote the code to production at `2020.mchacks.ca`. Vercel also handles the SSL certificate for this site.

Along with deploy previews, the `develop` branch is live at `mchacks7.now.sh` for an easier comparison to production.
