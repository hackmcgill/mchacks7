        <h1>Travel Policy</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          At McHacks, we look forward to providing travel accomodation for as
          many attendees as we can. We care about bringing a great travel
          experience and so, we have outlined a few rules in this policy to
          adhere to that mission.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Our travel policy is complementary to the{" "}
          <a href="/code-of-conduct" target="_top">
            McHacks Code of Conduct
          </a>
          . If you’re an attendee with any travel accommodation, this policy
          applies alongside our Code of Conduct.
        </p>
        <h2>Buses</h2>
        <h3>Seat Capacity</h3>
        <p>
          Bus seats are available at a first-come first-serve basis to all
          attendees with an acceptance status on our hacker dashboard. Seats
          must be used by the same attendee to/from McHacks.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          If an attendee can no longer attend, please email{" "}
          <a href="mailto:contact@mchacks.ca" target="_top">
            contact@mchacks.ca
          </a>{" "}
          to discuss arrangements for a refund so we can open the seat up to
          other interested attendees.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          An attendee will no longer be eligible for a refund after January 29,
          2020 though please still{" "}
          <a href="mailto:contact@mchacks.ca" target="_top">
            contact
          </a>{" "}
          us so we can open the seat up for others.
        </p>
        <h3>Deposits</h3>
        <p>
          To secure a seat on one of our buses, an attendee must place a
          monetary deposit at the time of seat security. Bus seats cannot be
          traded or sold to another attendee or person at anytime.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Bus deposits are refunded to the attendee if they (a) confirm their
          attendance on our hacker dashboard, (b) check-in to McHacks as a
          hacker, and (c) submit a project to at least one of our prize
          categories.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Deposits will be refunded to attendees upon review of the above
          qualifications and distributed within 15 days after McHacks.
        </p>
        <h2>Self-Arranged Travel</h2>
        <p>
          Any attendee is welcome to arrange their own travel accommodations to
          and from McHacks. Liability, safety, and insurance related to
          self-arranged travel is unaffiliated with McHacks and left to an
          attendee's discretion.
        </p>
        <h3>Travel Offer</h3>
        <p>
          On a case-by-case basis, an attendee may be offered a monetary travel
          offer on their hacker dashboard to support their own travel
          arrangements to and from McHacks.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The travel offer given to any attendee may be retracted at the McHacks
          team’s discretion.
        </p>
        <h3>Travel Reimbursement</h3>
        <p>
          An attendee is eligible for travel reimbursement of the offer amount
          indicated on their hacker dashboard if they (a) confirm their
          attendance on our hacker dashboard, (b) check-in to McHacks as a
          hacker, and (c) submit a project to at least one of our prize
          categories.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          An attendee must upload and provide a digital copy of their travel
          receipts to be eligible for travel reimbursement. These receipts must
          be provided to McHacks by February 1, 2020 at 12:00pm EST.

          All travel reimbursements will be issued via Interac e-Transfer to an
          attendee’s email address indicated in their application within 15 days
          after McHacks. If an e-Transfer is not accepted by March 1, 2020 at
          12:00pm EST, the e-Transfer will cancel and an attendee will not
          longer be able to claim their travel reimbursement.
