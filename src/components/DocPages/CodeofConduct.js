        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
        McHacks aims to be a hackathon where all participants and volunteers feel welcome, included, respected and safe. All 
				attendees–including sponsors, students, speakers, judges, volunteers, and organizers–are therefore required to abide by 
				the following code of conduct at all times.
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        Our hackathon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free space for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, 
				ability, physical appearance, race, or religion.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        We do not tolerate harassment in any form from participants. Sexual language and inappropriate imagery is not appropriate for 
				submitted projects or at any time or place during the event, including talks, workshops, receptions, and online media. Attendees 
				violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without travel reimbursement at the discretion of the event 
				organizers. Any events that violate the McHacks Code of Conduct should be reported as specified in the procedures at the end of 
				the document.
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				Additionally, attendees are expected to comply with the&nbsp;
				 <a href="https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">Major League Hacking (MLH) code of conduct all times.</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Full Version</h2>
        <p>
        Harassment includes, but is not limited to: offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, ability, 
				physical appearance, race, religion; sexual or graphic images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking, following, 
				harassing; photography or video recording someone without their consent; sustained disruption of talks or other events; 
				inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Participants exhibiting any of these harmful behaviours will be asked to stop immediately. Sponsors, speakers, volunteers and 
				organizers are also expected to follow the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, 
				ctivities, or other graphic materials. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, 
				or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In addition, hacks or projects submitted by teams that violate this code may be disqualified or denied the right to demo at the 
				discretion of the event organizers.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Any bus ticket reserved by a participant with a deposit may not be traded, redistributed, or sold to any other participant or 
				person. If a participant wishes to unreserve a ticket and receive a refund, they must send an email to&nbsp;
				<a href="mailto:contact@mchacks.ca" target="_top">contact@mchacks.ca</a>&nbsp;along 
				with an order receipt detailing information about the transaction. 
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Photography is encouraged, but participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. 
				If they object to being photographed, please comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts 
				where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy, for example in bathrooms or when participants are sleeping.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        If a participant engages in harmful behaviour, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning 
				the perpetrator or expelling them from the event with no reimbursement.
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please follow the reporting 
				procedures at the bottom of this document and report the incident immediately. Hackathon staff will be clearly identified and the 
				Co-Directors can be reached at all times via the phone numbers below.
				<br></br>	
				<br></br>
				Hackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise 
				assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance and expect participants 
				to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and all related social events.
        </p>
